<head>CHAPTER IX<foreign>(rv</foreign>) BIOGRAPHY OF THE MAIN WISE AND HOLY PEOPLE WHO INHABITED TOMBOUCTOU AT VARIOUS TIMES (God have mercy on them, show them his satisfaction and let us profit from their influence in this world and in the next!) MENTION OF THEIR MERITS AND THEIR WORKS.</head>
<p>In this regard, it will suffice to reproduce what has been reported by trustworthy people from the master, the learned, the eminent, the holy character, the author of prodigies and miracles, the jurisconsult, the cadi Mohammed-El-Kabari (God have mercy on him!). This is what he said: "I have known saints from Sankore whose virtues have never been surpassed by anyone except the Companions of the Envoy of God (God bless him and give them all his satisfaction!). Among these people, we will mention :</p>
<p>The jurisconsult El-Hâdj, grandfather of the cadi Abderrahman-ben-Abou-Bekr-ben-El-Hâdj. - He was invested with the functions of cadi of Timbuktu in the last years of the dynasty of the people of Melli. He was the first to order the reading of half a hizb of the Koran as a teaching<ref target="1"/>. This reading took place in the mosque of Sankore after the <foreign>asr</foreign> prayer and after the evening prayer. Together with his brother, the jurisconsult Ibrahim, he came from Biro, and he established himself

In Benka<ref target="1"/>, where his tomb is located, which is well known and to which people go on pilgrimage.</p>
<p>It is said that he was a thaumaturgist, and our master, the eminent, the ascetic, the jurisconsult, El-Amin-ben-Ahmed, has reported the following fact: It was in his time that the Sultan of Mossi made his expedition against Benka. The population of this locality went out to fight the enemy, and at this time a certain number of people were sitting near El-Hàdj. He said some words about millet and invited the people to eat it. All of them ate it except for one person, the son-in-law of El-Hajj, who did not dare to do so because of the ties of kinship that bound him to him. "Go now to battle," said the saint, "and you will have nothing to fear from the enemy's dashes." All, indeed, came back safe and sound, and only the person who had not eaten millet died in this fight. The Sultan of Mossi, routed, was driven out as well as his troops without having obtained the least advantage over the people of Benka and that thanks to the protection of this blessed holy person.</p>
<p>From this El-Hadj descended the holy personage in God<foreign>(vw</foreign>), the jurisconsult Ibrahim, son of the holy jurisconsult, the cadi Omar living in Yendibo'o<ref target="2"/>. Both the father and the son were fervent worshippers of God.</p>
<p>It was Askia-El-Hàdj-Mohammed who appointed 'Omar as cadi in this region. The latter had a nephew (son of his sister) who, from time to time, went on pilgrimage<ref target="3"/> to Timbuktu. The cadi of this city, the juriscon-

consult Mahmoud, came to complain to the Emir Askia-El-Hâdj-Mohammed that this nephew was spying on what he was saying and was then reporting it to the people of Yendibo'o. When the prince camped at Tila, Cadi Omar surrounded by the notables of the town of Yendiboʻo came to greet him. "Where is this nephew?" asked the prince. - Here he is," was the reply. - So," he added, "it is you who are reporting to your maternal uncle the words spoken by the jurisconsult Mahmud." On hearing this speech, the cadi 'Omar cried out in anger: "It is you who are the cause of all these intrigues, since you have appointed a cadi in Timbuktu and another in Yendibo'o!" Thereupon the cadi, highly irritated, headed for the port, saying to his companions: "Let's leave, let's cross the river and let's go! When the cadi arrived at the edge of the river, he was about to enter it when he was told: "The boat has not yet arrived, wait until it comes. - And if there was none?" he answered. His companions, understanding that he wanted to cross the river without waiting for the boat, held him back and made him sit down until the boat had arrived, and then they all crossed the river together (God have mercy on them and let us benefit from them! Amen!).</p>
<p>The jurisconsult Abu-Abdullah-Anda-Ag-Mohammed<ref target="1"/>-ben-Mohammed-ben-'Otsmân-ben-Mohammed-ben-Nouh, a treasure of science, merits and virtues. From him came many masters of science and holy people: some from his father's side, others from his mother's side and others from both sides at the same time. This illustrious scholar was a cadi of the Muslims.</p>
<p>The very learned jurisconsult Ahmed-Baba (God have mercy on him!) said: "He was the first of my ancestors

who devoted himself to science, as far as I can tell. He was my paternal great-great-grandfather, the father of my grandfather's mother. He was appointed to the position of cadi of Timbuktu in the middle of the ninth century. - I add that at that time the Tuareg reigned in this city. - After him, Ahmed-Baba continues, it was 'Omar, the father of my grandfather; he was also a jurisconsult, a theologian, a pious character; he had followed the courses of the jurisconsult, the virtuous cadi Mouaddib-Mohammed-El-Kabari. Here ends the quotation in summary of the words of the jurisconsult Ahmed-Baba.</p>
<p>The son of the previous one, the jurisconsult El-Mokhtâr, grammarian and scholar in all the branches of science<foreign>(ra</foreign>). He was, as well as his father, the contemporary of the jurisconsult of the scholar, the pole, the holy personage in God, Sidi Yahya-Et-Tâdelsi (God have mercy on them all and show them his satisfaction!). He died towards the end of the year 922 (1516).</p>
<p>The brother of the previous one, the jurisconsult Abderrahman. - He had a thorough knowledge of the Tehdib<ref target="1"/> of El-Berâdi'i. A pious and gentle man, he died without leaving any posterity other than an only daughter.</p>
<p>The grandson of Abu-Abdullah, Abu-'1.'Abbâs-AhmedBoryo-ben-Ahmed-ben-Anda-Ag-Mohammed. This pious scholar detached himself from the goods of this world and lived in the greatest humility. He was the teacher of many masters of science among the modern inhabitants of Sankore (God have mercy on him!).</p>

the grammarian, the son of Anda-Ag-Mohammed, was imam of the mosque of Sankore; he was appointed to this post by the sheikh-el-islam, the father of blessings, the jurisconsult and cadi Mahmud, when the latter, because of his old age, resigned his functions. He was a shy, modest, humble scholar, full of trust in God and known for his knowledge of the Arabic language: he celebrated the glory of the Prophet (may God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!) and during Ramadan, in the mosque of Sankore, he gave a complete reading of the book of cadi 'Iyad, entitled: Ech-Chifa<ref target="1"/> (God have mercy on him!).</p>
<p>Abu-Abdullah-Mohammed, son of Imam AndaAg-Mohammed, the panegyrist of the Prophet and the reader of the book of Ech-Chifa of the caïd 'Tyâd in the mosque of Sankoré after the death of his father; he fulfilled this office until his death (God be merciful to him!).</p>
<p>The jurisconsult El-Mokhtâr-ben-Mohammed, son of the jurisconsult, the grammarian El-Mokhtar-ben-AndaAg-Mohammed, the panegyrist of the Prophet. He paid bards on the occasion of the Prophet's nativity feast and took great pleasure in hearing them; he was very active in this field until his death (God have mercy on him!).</p>
<p>The son of the previous one, the jurisconsult, MohammedSan, son of the jurisconsult El-Mokhtàr, the chief of the panegyrists.

He practiced all these virtues throughout his life. Praise be to God! He was a descendant of the jurisconsult Anda-AgMohammed the elder (or the great) on his father's and mother's side. His mother was the daughter of the jurisconsult, the Imam, Anda-Ag-Mohammed. Likewise the jurisconsult, cadi Mohammed-Qarayenki and his brother, the jurisconsult, cadi Sidi Ahmed, both had the daughter of the jurisconsult, imam Anda-Ag-Mohammed as their mother, and their father was the jurisconsult Anda-Ag-Mohammed, the son of the jurisconsult Anda-Ag-Mohammed-ben-Ahmed-ben-Boryo-ben-Ahmed, the son of the jurisconsult Anda-Ag-Mohammed the great. This blessed imam had five blessed daughters who all gave birth to blessed men: first the two we have just named; the third was the mother of the master of masters, of the imam of the mosque of Sankore, the jurisconsult Mohammed-ben-Mohammed-Korai; the fourth gave birth to the bearer<ref target="1"/> of the holy book, Mohammed-benYomzoghorbir; finally the fifth was the mother of Ahmed-Mâtina-ben-Asikala, brother of Atakorai<ref target="2"/>.</p>
<p>The jurisconsult Aboul-'Abbâs-Ahmed-ben-Anda. Ag-Mohammed-ben-Mohammed, son of the jurisconsult Anda-Ag-Mohammed the great. He was a pure and wise man, well educated in various branches of science, law, grammar, poetry, etc. (God have mercy on him!).</p>
<p>Abu-Mohammed-Abdallah, son of the jurisconsult Ahmed-Boryo-ben-Ahmed, son of the jurisconsult Anda-AgMohammed the great. - He was descended from this personage by the paternal and maternal sides; his mother was the sister of the jurisconsult Aboul-'Abbâs-Ahmed-ben-Anda-Ag-Mohammed. Mufti of his time, grammarian, lexicographer, modest man, he was famous in his time by his knowledge of the

of the Qur'an and of the notarial profession <ref target="1"/> (God have mercy on him!). </p>
<p>Three of the grandsons of the previous one by their mother. These sheikh-al-islam, these learned imams were: the jurisconsult Abdallah; the jurisconsult El-Hâdj-Ahmed and the jurisconsult Mahmoud, all three sons of the jurisconsult 'Omarben-Mohammed-Aqit. The scholar in God, the pole Sidi Mohammed-El-Bekri, said about these three characters: "Ahmed was a saint; Mohammed was a saint; Abdallah was a saint. This last one would be well known as a saint) if he had not lived in a village<ref target="2"/>; for he remained in Tâzekhta until his death. He had recommended that his body should not be washed by anyone except his disciple Ibrahim, grandfather of Habib-ben-Mohammed-Baba. When Ibrahim came to perform his funeral task, he found a lighted lamp next to the deceased. He then said to the family members: "Where is the<foreign>sheikh</foreign>'s rosary? They brought it to him. Then he had the lamp extinguished and put the rosary in its place. A bright light came out of the rosary and illuminated the room until the end of the washing of the body. El-HâdjAhmed was a pious servant of God and a practicing doctor.</p>
<p>As for Mahmud, he is the author of many prodigies and blessings. How many times, invoked in deserted places to avert a danger or an accident, he appeared and cleared the one who called him. When his elder brother El-Hâdj-Ahmed (God have mercy on him and help us for his sake!) was buried, he returned home so saddened that he did not pay any attention to the people who came to offer him their condolences. When he arrived in front of the house of Otsmân-Thảleb, he sighed deeply and cried out:</p>

<p>"Now my brother Ahmed has left me, he is with the angels." Everyone understood that he saw the angels and that is why he was saddened. This is a remarkable kind of wonder and divination.</p>
<p>The main person who attended Mahmoud's meetings was the jurisconsult El-Mosalli, whose real name was Anda-Ag-Mohammed-ben-Mellouk-ben-Ahmedben-El-Hâdj-Ed-Doleïmi from the family of the Zaouïa in Morocco and who was also called<ref target="1"/> the maternal grandfather of the jurisconsult Mahmoud. His nickname was El-Mosalli<ref target="2"/> because of the numerous prayers he used to do in the mosque. This El-Mosalli reported the following fact: I had formed the project of asking the sheikh for the hand of one of his daughters and I had written my request with the intention of giving it to him when all the ordinary assistance had withdrawn and we would be alone. No sooner were we alone than he spoke first and said, "Birds that are of the same species are the only ones that fly together." I understood then that he had guessed my project and I abandoned it. El-Mosalli (God have mercy on him!) died in the year 995 (1587); at that time the very learned, the jurisconsult, the cadi Abu Hafs-'Omar, had held the office of cadi for two years.</p>
<p>Abu - Hafs - 'Omar-ben - El - Hâdj-Ahmed-ben-Omar-ben-Mohammed-Aqît, the grammarian; he was always praising the Prophet in the morning and in the evening and every day of Ramadan<ref target="3"/>, he was reading the whole book of Ech-Chifa in the mosque of Sankoré. He was kind to his family and very attached to his relatives, inquiring about their health and visiting them

He died as a martyr<ref target="1"/> in the city of Merrakech (God have mercy on him, show him satisfaction, cool his grave<ref target="2"/> <foreign>(qq</foreign>) and make him dwell in a large house in the highest heaven!)</p>
<p>The father of the previous one, A bou-Bekr, known as Aboukar-Bir-ben-El-Hâdj-Ahmed-ben-Omarben-Mohammed-Aqît. - He was a scholar, ascetic and charitable, and he provided for the needs of orphans and students. During his reign<ref target="2"/> he emigrated with all his wives and children to be closer to the Envoy of God (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!). In his love for God and his Prophet, he settled in the noble city of Madinah and remained there, with all his family, in the neighborhood of the Chosen One<ref target="3"/>, until his death.</p>
<p>He had already conceived the idea of taking all his family with him on his first pilgrimage to Mecca; he had even taken them out of the city and led them to a certain distance, when the cadi, the righteous El-'Aqib, knowing that Abonkar would not return and not wanting to part with them for good, obliged the family to stay. But on his second pilgrimage, as El-'Aqib had died, Abubar left with all his family and went to settle in the vicinity of the noble city of Medina and all of them remained there until their death.</p>

asked blessings of the father, the saint in God, the pole, Sidi Mohammed El-Bekri (God have mercy on them all and show them his satisfaction!) to show him one of the saints of God whose support he could obtain from the Lord. El-Bekri granted him this favor. One night, after having made, in the mosque of El-Azhar<ref target="1"/>, the second evening prayer, at the moment when he was going to leave the mosque, El-Bekri who held by a hand the jurisconsult Ahmed, put this hand on the head of a man sitting there in the darkness while saying: " Here is what you asked me! " Ahmed sat down before this man, greeted him and recognized his brother Aboukar-Bir. He talked with him for a moment; then he went out and found El-Bekri waiting for him at the door of the mosque. This is the one you wanted to show me," he said. - Yes," he replied, "every night he does the second evening prayer here.</p>

It will suffice, to testify to this esteem and his reputation, to quote what the holy, virtuous Abu-Abdallah-Mohammed-El-Bekri said about him, in a poem he sent when he parted from him. Here are these verses:</p>

<p>The children of the Sheikh-el-Islam, the source of blessings, the saint of God, the jurisconsult, the cadi, Mahmud-ben-Omar-ben-Mohammed-Aqit were: the cadi Mohammed, the cadi El-`Aqib, the cadi 'Omar, the jurisconsult Abdallah, the holy ascetic, the jurisconsult Abderrahman. The blessing of Islam, the jurisconsult 'Omar-Anda-Ag-Mohammed and the eminent sheikh, the jurisconsult Baba-Masira-Bir said, "Mahmud-ben-'Omar has graced us with nothing but virtuous children."</p>

<p>The cadi Abu-Hafs-'Omar. - He distinguished himself in the science of traditions, biographies, annals and history. In law he reached the highest degree of knowledge, so much so that a sheikh of his contemporaries said of him: "If he had lived at the time of Ibn Abd-es-Selâm in Tunis he would have deserved to occupy in this city the functions of mufti.</p>

He was gifted with second sight and the students of his medrasa tell many anecdotes about him, among them the following one which has been quoted many times:</p>

He did so in the following manner: When he had finished the dohor prayer with everyone, he sat down in his medrasa and said, "By God! By God! By God! you will hear something this year that you have never heard, and see what you have never seen." In the month of Jomada Jer of that same year (February 25-March 27, 1591), Moroccan troops arrived in Sudan and did what is known

He was rigorously just even to the humblest of men; he never concealed what was right, even from emirs or sultans. The name of Mohammed was written on his right forearm in white lines naturally formed on the skin. All those we have mentioned since the biography of the blessed sheikh, the jurisconsult Anda-Ag-Mohammed the great, until this moment, were of his blessed race and his virtuous family (may God have mercy on them all, show them his satisfaction and make us enjoy their blessings in this world and in the next).</p>
<p>As for the grandfather of the jurisconsult Mahmoud, Mohammed-Aqit, he was originally from the Masina. I heard the jurisconsult Ahmed-Baba (God have mercy on him!) say that "Mohammed-Aqit left the Masina to go to Biro only because of the hatred of the Foulani<ref target="1"/>, who lived in the vicinity of his dwelling, that he was certain that there had never been a marriage between his family and the Foulani<foreign>(7</foreign>), but that he feared that his children would not do the same, and that their lineage would thus be mixed with Foulani blood. )</p>
<p>Later, he felt the desire to live in Timbuktu. This was at the time when Sultan Akil was ruling. He left Biro, came to set up his tent between Biro and Ras-el-ma, and as he was talking with Masira-Anda-'Omar's grandfather, the latter said to him: "Who is preventing you from going to this city? - He replied, "Because there is a strong enmity between Akil and me. - Well, God willing," said his interlocutor, "I will be the cause that will put an end to this enmity and you will live in Tom-

Then, entering his tent, Akil soon came out with a shield all lacerated with spear and saber blows. "See," he added, "what Mohammed-Aqit has done to me. How can a man live in the same city as an enemy who has treated him like this? -- Let it go, then; all that you say there is past. Today this man is poor; he has a large family and he only wants to live in peace." Then he added so many gentle and persuasive words that Akil's hatred subsided and he allowed MohammedAqît to come to Timbuktu. Masira's grandfather went to find his friend, told him what had happened, and Mohammed and his family set out to stay in Timbuktu.</p>
